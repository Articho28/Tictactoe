# Tictactoe
This is a simple 2 player tic tac toe game developed to get familiar with Python. 
The logic was provided by the Complete Python Bootcamp class available on Udemy. The implementation of the functions was my own work. 

Please note that the goal was to make it functional as soon as possible. This was put together really quickly: I am aware that many improvements to code quality can be made. 

Enjoy!
